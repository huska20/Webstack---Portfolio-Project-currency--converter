# Calculator Project

This project implements a simple scientific calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the calculator project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd calculator-project

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
- Right-click on `index.html`
- Select "Open with" and choose your preferred web browser

4. The calculator should now be displayed in your web browser, and you can start using it for calculations.

## Usage Guidelines

### Basic Operations:
- Enter numbers using the number buttons (0-9).
- Use the arithmetic operator buttons (+, -, *, /) for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Press the "=" button to calculate the result.

### Additional Features:
- Special functions such as square root (√), percentage (%), and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) are available.
- Use the backspace button (⌫) to delete the last entered character.
- Clear the calculator display by pressing the "C" button.

### Keyboard Shortcuts:
- You can also use your keyboard to input numbers and perform calculations.
- Use the Enter key to calculate the result.

## Overview of Project Architecture

The project follows a simple architecture with the following structure:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the calculator interface.
- `style.css`: Defines the styles for the calculator interface, including layout and appearance.
- `calculator.js`: Implements the calculator functionality using JavaScript, handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display.

The JavaScript code is structured to handle different types of buttons (numbers, operators, special functions) and their corresponding actions. Event listeners are used to capture user input and update the display accordingly.
